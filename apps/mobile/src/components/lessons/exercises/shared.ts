/**
 * The contract every exercise component implements.
 *
 * An exercise never grades itself against the answer key and never advances the
 * session. It reports a draft answer upwards and the shell decides what happens,
 * which is what keeps grading rules in one testable module.
 *
 * The exception is a self-grading exercise such as matching, where each pair is
 * judged as it is tapped. Those call `onSelfSubmit` once the whole exercise is
 * done, and the shell hides the Check button for them.
 *
 * The answer type is derived from the exercise type, so a multiple-choice
 * exercise cannot report a sentence answer — the compiler rejects it.
