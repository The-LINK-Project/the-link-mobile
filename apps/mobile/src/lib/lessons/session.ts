/**
 * Lesson session state.
 *
 * One reducer owns the whole run: which exercise is on screen, the draft
 * answer, the grade, and the mistake queue. Screens and exercise components
 * hold no session state of their own, so the flow stays testable without
 * rendering anything.
 *
 * Design decisions worth knowing:
 * - There are no hearts or energy. A wrong answer never blocks progress; the
 *   exercise is put back on the end of the queue instead. That is Duolingo's
 *   own spaced-repetition reasoning, minus the part that locks people out.
 * - Progress never moves backwards. The bar is `position / queue.length`, and
 *   the queue only ever grows, so a mistake slows the bar rather than undoing it.
 * - A run can be saved and picked up again. What is saved is the queue, the
 *   position and the records: never the answer being built, because an exercise
 *   keeps the look of its half-built answer to itself and would come back
 *   disagreeing with it. A learner returns to the start of the exercise they
 *   were on. A run is thrown away when the lesson's exercises have changed
 *   underneath it, which `fingerprint` detects.
